$ Variables are declared using the 'let' keyword.
let myVariable = 2

$ Functions can be declared using the following syntax
fn myFunc[] do
    $ Rather than having a generic "return", we'll use 'give'
    give 3
done

$ Functions can be invoked as follows:
myFunc[]

$ [] and () are considered the same thing, so we could also do this:
myFunc()
