$ Variables are declared using the 'let' keyword.
let myVariable = 2;

$ Functions can be declared using the following syntax
fn myFunc[] {
    $ Rather than having a generic "return", we'll use 'give'
    give 3;
}

$ Functions can be invoked as follows:
myFunc[];

$ [] and () are considered the same thing, so we could also do this:
myFunc();
