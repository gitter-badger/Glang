# Glang
Created by [Gigabyte Giant](https://github.com/Gigabyte-Giant) because everyone knows that the world needs another lame programming language.

## The idea
The idea for this project is quite simple-- *create a simple programming language that Giga would like*.
Oh, and, the code will be [transpiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to C.

## Syntax
For now, you'll have to figure out the (planned) syntax of Glang by looking at the [language's specification](https://github.com/Gigabyte-Giant/Glang/blob/master/languageSpec.txt).

Keep in mind, none of the "rules" are final, unless otherwise noted.
